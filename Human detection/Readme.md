# 🧍 Human Detection

This is the **first step** of our project — detecting humans in video frames using a pre-trained deep learning model.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Download** the file: `human_detection.ipynb`  
2. **Place** the following files in the **same directory**:
   - `walking.mp4` — the input video file  
   - `frozen_inference_graph.pb` — the pre-trained TensorFlow model  
3. **Run** the notebook (`human_detection.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
